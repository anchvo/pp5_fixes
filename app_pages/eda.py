    # Page Explanation
    st.markdown("""
    The following content of the **Exploratory Data Analysis** gives an overview of the first steps of the development workflow: 
                
    - Data Understanding
    - Data Preparation

    In those steps, the dataset from Kaggle was collected, inspected and cleaned to allow working with the data. 
                
    Decisions were made based on the previously stated business requirements and hypothesis and the continous results of the data analysis.

    Visualisations of key analysis components include: 

    - Class Distribution
    - Correlation Heatmap
    - General Feature Importances Overview       
    - Pandas Profiling Report
                
    For the conclusion of the results, please view the end of this page.
