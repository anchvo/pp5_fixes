    The following content of the **Malware Threat Predictor** allows the use of two prediction models: 
                
    - Threat Level Prediction by Class
    - Threat Prediction by Feature Input

    The prediction runs with a trained model based on Rain Forest Classification. It currently has a balanced accuracy of 45%.
                
    Please be aware that predictions can therefore not be fully accurate.

        f"* Multiple models were trained to test for the best option: Linear Regression, Rain Forest, Linear SVC, XGB.\n"
        f"* Rain Forest Classification was chosen for the final model based on performance results of different types of models.\n"
        f"* The final model was tuned with feature adjustment and hyperparemeter tuning.\n"
        f"* The final model is currently based on a balanced train set accounting for high imbalance in the original dataset.\n"

        f"* Basic functionality of the trained model exists.\n"
        f"* The model can successfully predict two different types of threat assessments.\n"
        f"* The balanced accuracy of 45% however, restrict the real world use as the predictions are made with too high inaccuracy.\n"

    # Business Requirements and Hypotheses Conclusions
    st.success(
        f"**Answers to Business Requirements and Hypotheses**\n"
        f"* A predictive model was developed that allows automated threat classification into four distinct classes, supporting the client's requirement for real-time detection.\n"
        f"* Model performance reached 45% balanced accuracy, confirming that classification is possible but not yet reliable for production use ‚Äî further tuning or data balancing needed.\n"
        f"* Class probability outputs for both bulk and individual predictions demonstrate the model's ability to produce risk-level outputs, partially validating the use of probability thresholds for alerting.\n"
